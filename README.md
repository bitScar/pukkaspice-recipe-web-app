# pukkaspice-recipe-website
Recipe creation and sharing web application. Written with Java, Spring, JSP, Angular.

This was a website that I had running on OpenShift until there fee offering of space was revoked. The
code is not as clean I would have normally but I had little time to write it. It serves as an example
of how to set-up and use Spring Security; how to setup Cucumber tets, and Selienium tests. It was also my
first time using Angualar 1.0 so don't judge to harshly. I also didn't know how to use JS build tools at the 
time of writing this.
