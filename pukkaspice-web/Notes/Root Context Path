Problem:
When trying to use angularjs routing the changing context path can be a problem.

Solution:
In Tomcat server.xml change
<Context docBase="com.pukkaspice.web" path="/pukkaspice" reloadable="true" source="org.eclipse.jst.jee.server:com.pukkaspice.web"/></Host>
to
<Context docBase="com.pukkaspice.web" path="/" reloadable="true" source="org.eclipse.jst.jee.server:com.pukkaspice.web"/></Host>

otherwise we would need to set a variable somewhere and take to context path into account in the js code

I think we may also have to rename the war to "root" when deploying to openshift otherwise to will use the war name as the  context root
