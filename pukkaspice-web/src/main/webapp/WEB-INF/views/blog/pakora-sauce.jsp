								<p>Pakora is ubiquitous in Scotland . Every takeaway, supermarket, fish and chip shop, and Indian restaurant sell it in some form or another. Scottish people love anything fried, so when when migrants in the 1950's and 60's came from what was India just 10 or 20 years before and opened restaurants and takeaways, the Scottish people heartedly embraced which I'm sure was then was an exotic delight.</p>
								<p>Recipes for pakora have barely evolved since then, although now, pakora just isn't complete without a sauce to dip it in. I'm not talking about the traditional mango or tamarind chutney. I'm taking about a sauce so intensely colored that it leaves stains on your fingers and a lasting aroma that reminds you about it in the day that follows.</p>

								<p>In general you will find that the sauce comes in two forms which we refer to as "Red Sauce" and "Pink Sauce".</p>
								<p>I'm going to show you how to make a version of the Red and Pink sauces, but also another variant invented by my father which we just call Dad's Pakora Sauce in my family. They are all simple, easy to make, and taste great. My advice is to use a really good quality mint sauce, and tomato ketchup - cheap stuff is just too vinegary and won't taste as good. You also need to taste and adjust as go - trust your taste buds and you won't go wrong.</p>

									<p class='post-content'>You may find that you need to adjust the sweet and sour balance with this recipe. If it tastes too sour with lemon then add a pinch or two of sugar, and if too sweet add just a dash more lemon. It should just be slightly on the sour side though.</p>

									<p class='post-content'>Be very careful with the amount of salt in this. Yogart greatly enhances the perception of sweet and sour flavours, so it is really easy to over do it. You could even just leave the salt out to  be on the safe side.</p>

							<p>I hope you enjoy making these. As you can see they are not difficult to make and they do taste great. They can easily be enjoyed as dips with Samosa or any other fried Indian snack. Restaurant and takeaway recipe often have food coloring added to them, but I have never felt the need to do this at home. If you prefer to had a bit of finger staining then feel free to experiement with a little red or yellow coloring</p>
