Deployment 2016.1

First Deployment

- Deployment not working for ages but this was because web had an out of date server jar ** Make sure build order is correct next time ***
- Gmail not working so set-up account with Mailgun

- "rhc port-forward pukkaspice" to start using db from pc

- Can tail log with "rhc tail -a pukkaspice"
- Build server, web
- Copy war
- Paste to webapps folder
- Delete old war 
- * Rename war to ROOT.was
- * Open GIT Bash (this only one that works properly)
- git add ROOT.was
- git commit -m "[message here]"
- git push

** Don't forget to change back profile attibute values if you change from PROD
